            This Policy covers what personal information we collect from you,
            what we do with it, and how you can find out more information.

          <li>
            We mainly use your personal information to provide you with relevant
            information about how to get vaccinated.
          </li>
          <li>
            We may collect your personal information when you interact with us

        Vaccine Hunters Canada (“VHC”, “we” or “us”), is a non-profit
        organization made up of volunteers dedicated to helping Canadians
        navigate the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, understand the complexities of
        vaccine eligibility, and connect eligible Canadians with appointment
        opportunities.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Policy applies to our website (available at
        vaccinehunters.ca and which includes appointments.vaccinehunters.ca)
        (our “website”) and any other interactions you may have with us,
        including on our social media accounts or channels or by email (we’ll
        call this the “Services”). We provide the Services to help provide
        Canadians with information on how to get vaccinated. We do not provide
        Services outside Canada or encourage people outside Canada to provide
        any personal information.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Policy specifically covers our handling of personal information
        relating to identifiable individuals (“personal information” or “your
        information”) and does not apply to anonymous or business information.
        <br />
        <br />
        By visiting or using our website or sharing information with us, you
        consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy
        Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Information we collect and use to provide the Services</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We collect and use your personal information to provide the Services.
        The types of information we collect and use will depend on what you
        choose to provide when you interact with us, but will usually relate to
        your eligibility for vaccination (for example, your age) and your
        location.
        <br />
        <br />
        We collect and use this information when:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>You communicate with us through the Services.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you ask us a question on social media or through email, we
              use the information you provide us to answer the question as best
              we can. We may ask for more information to help us answer the
              question.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may interact with you in the ways permitted on social media
              platforms, such as responding to, liking, re-posting, retweeting,
              and quoting your social media posts. These interactions are aimed
              at building our community and promoting awareness of vaccination
              information and opportunities to get vaccinated.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>You use one of our tools.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We have developed, and are in the process of developing, tools to
              help you access vaccination information. These tools may require
              certain information from you to be of any use.
            </li>
            <li>
              For example, our Appointments tool requires your postal code so we
              can pull up information on vaccination appointments that are
              relevant based on your location.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        Keep in mind a few important reminders when you’re communicating with
        us:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You never have to provide us with information you don’t want to, but
            this may impact our ability to help you or your ability to
            communicate or engage with us.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you provide us with someone else’s personal information, you
            represent that you have their consent or other legal authority to do
            so.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you contact us on one of our social media channels or accounts,
            that information will also be subject to the social media company’s
            privacy policy. For example, if you send us a message on Twitter,
            that message will be subject to both Twitter’s privacy policy and
            this Privacy Policy.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Other reasons why we collect and use your information</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        There are a few other cases when we collect and use personal
        information:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>We think we can improve our Services.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We collect your personal information when you communicate with us
              through the Services to provide us with feedback, ideas, or other
              similar information.
            </li>
            <li>
              We may use the information you provide us to understand how you
              use our Services. For example, if we notice we’re getting the same
              question a lot, we may make a note of that and keep it in mind
              when we develop new tools or services. We won’t tie this
              information to you (or any specific individual) unless it’s
              necessary.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>We receive an application to work with us.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We receive an application to work with us. If you apply to
              volunteer with us, we will use the information relating to that
              application (such as your employment history) to assess your
              suitability to any of our available positions. We may also collect
              information from third parties about you, such as references you
              list, for the same purpose.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            We need to comply with legal obligations or protect ourselves.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We may need to collect or use your information to ensure we’re
              complying with legal requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
              We do not tolerate illegal activity, hate, harassment, or other
              toxic behaviour. If we witness you engaging in these activities on
              social media, we may block you or report you to the social media
              platform.
            </li>
            <li>
              In rare circumstances, we may also collect personal information to
              defend our legal rights. For example, we may collect and use
              personal information to investigate or resolve a breach of our
              Terms of Service.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <strong>Cookies and Do-Not-Track Requests</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We use cookies on this website. Cookies are essentially small packages
        of data stored on your internet browser that tell us about your browsing
        behaviour. We use that information to monitor usage of our website and
        improve it.
        <br />
        <br />
        For more information on cookies and how to manage them, check the

        <br />
        <br />
        Because of the rapidly changing state of technology, we cannot make any
        guarantees that our systems will be able to honour Do-Not-Track requests
        sent by your browser.

        <br />
        <strong>How and when we may share your information</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We don’t sell or lease your personal information to third parties.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may share your information for two main purposes:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>To work with our service providers.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We may share your information with “service providers,” which are
              organizations that assist us in operating VHC and providing the
              Services.
            </li>
            <li>
              When we share information with service providers, we require them
              to commit to protecting your personal information in line with our
              standards, and limit use and disclosure of the information for the
              specific purposes for which we supplied it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some of our service providers may be based outside of Canada. This
              means your information may be accessible to law enforcement
              authorities outside of your jurisdiction, in accordance with the
              laws of that jurisdiction.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>For legal reasons. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In rare circumstances, we may share your information about you if
              we reasonably believe that it is needed to:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or
                applicable law, rule, or regulation;
              </li>
              <li>
                Investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service
                violations;
              </li>
              <li>
                Protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or
                others; or
              </li>
              <li>Detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Getting and withdrawing your consent</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        When we collect, use or share your personal information we will do so
        with your consent for the purposes identified or as otherwise permitted
        or required by law. We may obtain your permission based on implied
        consent (including through this Privacy Policy) or through other means
        (such as express consent). However, in some situations, the law allows
        us to collect, use or disclose personal information without your
        consent.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can withdraw your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of
        your information at any time. However, in some cases withdrawing consent
        will mean that we can no longer provide you with certain services or
        perform certain tasks where the information is required to do so. For
        example, we can’t respond to a question regarding available vaccine
        appointments if we don’t know what province you live in.
        <br />
        <br />
        You may withdraw your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of
        your personal information at any time by contacting the Privacy Officer
        (see ‘Contact information’ below) and, subject to any legal constraints,
        we will comply with your request.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Data security and storage</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We protect your information by limiting access to it and by implementing
        reasonable physical, organizational and technological safeguards as
        appropriate.
        <br />
        <br />
        We only store your information for as long as it’s needed. After that,
        we will either destroy or de-identify the information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Accessing your information</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        When requested in writing, we will inform you of the existence, use, and
        disclosure of your personal information that we maintain.
        <br />
        <br />
        To access your personal information, submit a written a request that
        identifies yourself, the information you want to review and how we can
        contact you (see ‘Contact information’ below for how to contact us). We
        may not be able to provide you with all the information you request,
        depending on the circumstances, and there may be a charge for copies of
        your personal information.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Correcting your information</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We make reasonable efforts to keep your information accurate and
        up-to-date to the extent we hold onto this information for any extended
        period of time. If a change or correction is required, let us know right
        away. We’ll make any appropriate updates needed. You can review your
        personal information by reviewing your communications with us, or by
        requesting access to your personal information as described above.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Contact information</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or about
        our handling of your personal information, please contact our Privacy
        Officer in writing at:
        <br />

        Email: contact@vaccinehunters.ca.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please note that we may need to confirm your identity or request
        additional details in order to process your request. Please be patient
        with our response. We are a small organization run by volunteers and may
        not always have the resources to respond immediately.

        <strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong>
