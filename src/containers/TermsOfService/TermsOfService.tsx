        <strong>About VHC</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        VHC is a community of volunteers. Our mission is to help Canadians
        navigate the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, understand the complexities of
        vaccine eligibility, and connect eligible Canadians with appointment
        opportunities. Although we obtain information from some Public Health
        Units, we are not associated with any government authority. We do not
        provide medical advice.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Permissible Use</strong>
        <br />

        laws, who are 18 years of age or older, and who are not barred from
        using the website under applicable laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        Subject to these Terms, the Services can be used to access information
        on vaccines and potentially available vaccination appointments. With

        a model for non-profit organizations whose goal is to provide the public
        with information regarding vaccines.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Services are provided by VHC in good faith on an “as is” and “as
        available” basis for general information purposes. Users agree to bear
        all risks associated with their use of the Services, including any
        reliance on their availability, accuracy, completeness, timeliness,
        usefulness or appropriateness.
        <br />
        <br />

        contact us and we provide our express written consent to the use of the
        extension; and ii) you abide by any conditions we impose on that
        consent.

        VHC takes reasonable steps to ensure the security of its systems.

        <br />
        The Terms and Privacy Policy incorporated herein constitute the entire

        finds any provision of the Terms or portion thereof to be unenforceable,
        that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as
        to effect the intent of the Terms, and the remainder of the Terms shall
        continue in full force and effect. VHC’s failure to insist upon or
        enforce strict performance of any provision of the Terms or any right
        shall not be construed as a waiver of any such provision or right.
